title: Model Mutually Exclusive React Props with a Discriminated Union
---

## When to apply

Apply when one public React TypeScript component API must represent mutually exclusive modes that
require different props or callbacks, and boolean or optional fields let callers describe a
combination the UI does not support. First confirm that one public component surface is still
appropriate: the modes may require different data and behavior, but should not need independently
owned state, separate providers, unrelated composition, or distinct extension points. If they do,
expose named components instead of forcing both variants through one union.

## Guidance

Give each mode a literal discriminator such as `mode: "single"` or `mode: "range"`. Define one union
member per mode and require that mode's inputs and callbacks. Use `?: never` for known cross-mode
props that should reject supplied values, including values arriving through typed object spreads.
Narrow on the discriminator with an exhaustive `switch`; share only rendering that genuinely belongs
to both modes. Keep independent options such as `disabled` outside the mode union.

`?: never` is a compile-time constraint, not runtime validation. With `strictNullChecks` enabled and
`exactOptionalPropertyTypes` disabled, an optional `never` property still accepts explicitly
supplied `undefined`; non-`undefined` conflicting values are rejected, but property absence is not
guaranteed. `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` requires `strictNullChecks` and tightens assignments only
in projects whose `tsconfig` enables it; a reusable component library cannot require its consumers
to use that option. Use the discriminator as the runtime mode signal. If runtime behavior depends on
conflicting properties being absent, validate or normalize the input at the boundary rather than
trusting the type.

Assume the automatic JSX runtime (`jsx: "react-jsx"`) and the corresponding React JSX type
declarations. With the classic transform, include React in scope as required by the project.

```tsx
type SingleDateProps = {
  mode: "single";
  selectedDate: Date;
  onSelect: (date: Date) => void;
  startDate?: never;
  endDate?: never;
  onSelectRange?: never;
};

type DateRangeProps = {
  mode: "range";
  startDate: Date;
  endDate: Date;
  onSelectRange: (range: { start: Date; end: Date }) => void;
  selectedDate?: never;
  onSelect?: never;
};

export type DateSelectionProps = SingleDateProps | DateRangeProps;

function assertNever(_value: never): never {
  throw new Error("Unsupported date selection mode");
}

export function DateSelection(props: DateSelectionProps) {
  switch (props.mode) {
    case "single":
      return (
        <section>
          <p>Selected date: {props.selectedDate.toLocaleDateString()}</p>
          <button type="button" onClick={() => props.onSelect(props.selectedDate)}>
            Confirm date
          </button>
        </section>
      );
    case "range":
      return (
        <section>
          <p>
            Selected range: {props.startDate.toLocaleDateString()} – {props.endDate.toLocaleDateString()}
          </p>
          <button
            type="button"
            onClick={() => props.onSelectRange({ start: props.startDate, end: props.endDate })}
          >
            Confirm range
          </button>
        </section>
      );
    default:
      return assertNever(props);
  }
}
```

The `mode` field narrows the props for each branch. The single-date variant cannot provide a usable
range, while the range variant requires both endpoints and its range callback. The `switch` makes an
added union member a type-checking concern; its fixed fallback error is only a defensive failure for
values that bypass the TypeScript contract, not a substitute for validating external input.

## Anti-pattern

A calendar component accepts `mode?`, `selectedDate?`, `startDate?`, `endDate?`, `onSelect?`, and
`onSelectRange?`, with every field optional. A caller can provide only one range endpoint, omit the
callback required by the selected mode, or combine a single date with range-only values. The
implementation must handle a missing mode or incomplete data and guard reads of optional fields,
instead of receiving a variant whose required data is statically known.

## Why

Independent optional fields describe many combinations, including states the UI cannot use. A tagged
union ties each mode to its required inputs and callback, so TypeScript narrows the props by the
discriminator and catches invalid combinations at checked call sites. An exhaustive `switch` also
makes a newly added mode visible to the implementation.

## Exceptions and boundaries

Use separate named components when modes need independent state ownership, separate providers,
substantially different composition, or distinct extension points; a union should not force
unrelated UI through one public component. TypeScript does not validate JSON, URL state, JavaScript
callers, or other untrusted runtime input, so parse or validate those values before constructing
`DateSelectionProps`. Do not infer the mode from whether a cross-mode property exists; branch on the
explicit discriminator. See the `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` caveat above when checked assignments
must also reject explicitly supplied `undefined`.

## Example

A scheduling interface offers a single-day selection and a date-range selection through the same
calendar surface. Both variants share the calendar's public component boundary, but each needs
different selection data and a different callback. The code above is a compact prop-contract
example; a production calendar still needs to implement date navigation, selection, and validation.
