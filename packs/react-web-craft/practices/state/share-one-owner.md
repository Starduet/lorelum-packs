title: Keep Coordinated State at One Shared Owner
---

## When to apply

Apply when two or more components must make decisions from the same changing UI value—for example,
one edits a filter while another displays or clears that filter. Decide whether the value can remain
local, needs one shared owner, and how consumers should reach that owner.

## Guidance

Keep state inside one component when no other component needs to coordinate with it. When several
components must read or update the same value, move its single source of truth to the nearest common
React owner that can coordinate them. Pass the value and update callback through props when the path
is direct and understandable.

Use Context or a provider only when the consumers are separated by enough unrelated layers that prop
threading becomes a real cost, or when the component contract intentionally exposes a shared
provider boundary. Context changes how a value is reached; it does not make duplicate copies safe or
make the provider's state global. Avoid moving state to an application root just to make it
available to one nearby sibling.

Do not copy the value into each consumer and synchronize those copies with Effects, and do not reach
into another component through a ref. If the value belongs to a server, URL, or external store
rather than this React subtree, select that ownership model separately instead of stretching this
local-state decision.

## Anti-pattern

A search box owns `query`, while a sibling result summary owns another `query` initialized from
props. An Effect copies every keystroke into the summary's state. The two values can diverge when
either side changes, and the extra synchronization creates a second owner for one concept.

## Why

One mutable UI concept needs one authority. Placing that authority at the lowest owner shared by the
components lets them observe the same render value and send updates through an explicit path.
Lifting farther than necessary broadens who must render in response; duplicating the value creates
competing versions that require synchronization.

## Exceptions and boundaries

- If one component alone reads and changes the value, keep it local; anticipated future reuse is not
  a reason to add a provider.
- If a parent already controls a child through `value` and `onChange`, the parent is the owner; the
  child should not create a second editable copy unless a distinct local-override contract is
  intentional.
- If many distant descendants need one value, Context may reduce prop plumbing, but choose the
  provider's scope deliberately. This Practice does not prescribe compound-component APIs, a
  state-management library, or server-data caching.
- If two values merely happen to have the same current contents but represent different ownership or
  lifetimes, they are not necessarily duplicate state.

## Example

The review composer owns the selected rating because a child picker changes it while a sibling
summary and the submit control read it. The children receive one value and an update path; neither
keeps a second rating state.

```tsx
import { type FormEvent, useState } from "react";

type Rating = 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5;
const ratings: Rating[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

type RatingPickerProps = {
  name: string;
  value: Rating | null;
  onChange: (rating: Rating) => void;
};

function RatingPicker({ name, value, onChange }: RatingPickerProps) {
  return (
    <fieldset>
      <legend>Your rating</legend>
      {ratings.map((rating) => (
        <label key={rating}>
          <input
            type="radio"
            name={name}
            value={rating}
            checked={value === rating}
            onChange={() => onChange(rating)}
          />
          {rating} star{rating === 1 ? "" : "s"}
        </label>
      ))}
    </fieldset>
  );
}

function RatingSummary({ rating }: { rating: Rating | null }) {
  return <p>{rating === null ? "Choose a rating" : `Selected: ${rating} stars`}</p>;
}

export function ReviewComposer({
  submitReview,
}: {
  submitReview: (rating: Rating) => void;
}) {
  const [rating, setRating] = useState<Rating | null>(null);

  function handleSubmit(event: FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) {
    event.preventDefault();
    if (rating !== null) submitReview(rating);
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <RatingPicker name="review-rating" value={rating} onChange={setRating} />
      <RatingSummary rating={rating} />
      <button type="submit" disabled={rating === null}>
        Send review
      </button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

If the picker and summary later move far apart in the tree, keep the same single owner and consider
a narrowly scoped Context. Do not let each subtree invent its own rating value.
