title: Represent Mutually Exclusive UI Modes with One State
---

## When to apply

Apply when several booleans or optional fields jointly describe one workflow phase—for example, a
save can be idle, in progress, complete, or failed. Decide whether these values may truly coexist or
whether the current state shape permits impossible combinations.

## Guidance

If exactly one mode is active at a time, represent it with one status value. In TypeScript, a
discriminated union can attach data that belongs only to a particular mode, such as an error message
to the failed variant. Transition by replacing the whole state value so the next mode and its
associated data change together.

Keep independent facts separate when they can be true at the same time and have different owners or
lifetimes. Do not merge unrelated toggles merely to reduce the number of state variables, and do not
use this Practice to decide whether a value can be derived from other state.

## Anti-pattern

A label manager keeps `isCreating` and `editingLabelId` as separate state values. Nothing prevents
both from being active, so the UI can open a create-label editor and a rename editor at the same
time even though the product allows only one label editor.

## Why

Independent flags can encode every combination, including combinations the product does not allow.
One tagged mode can make “closed,” “creating,” and “renaming this label” exclusive, while carrying
an ID only for the rename mode.

## Exceptions and boundaries

- Keep separate state for facts that can coexist, such as “email alerts enabled” and “SMS alerts
  enabled.” Those are independent choices, not alternative phases.
- This Practice concerns the shape of one state concept. It does not require `useReducer`, a
  state-machine library, or a particular transition architecture.
- It does not address redundant render-derived values, prop synchronization, request deduplication,
  or races between concurrent operations.
- If a workflow has complex transitions or side effects, model those separately; a union makes valid
  states explicit but does not by itself enforce every transition rule.

## Example

A label manager supports either creating a label or renaming one existing label, never both editors
at once. One tagged state stores the active mode and the data needed for that mode.

```tsx
import { useState } from "react";

type Label = { id: string; name: string };
type EditorState =
  | { kind: "closed" }
  | { kind: "create"; name: string }
  | { kind: "rename"; id: string; name: string };

type LabelManagerProps = {
  labels: Label[];
  createLabel: (name: string) => void;
  renameLabel: (id: string, name: string) => void;
};

export function LabelManager({
  labels,
  createLabel,
  renameLabel,
}: LabelManagerProps) {
  const [editor, setEditor] = useState<EditorState>({ kind: "closed" });

  function updateName(name: string) {
    setEditor((current) =>
      current.kind === "closed" ? current : { ...current, name },
    );
  }

  function saveEditor() {
    if (editor.kind === "create") createLabel(editor.name);
    if (editor.kind === "rename") renameLabel(editor.id, editor.name);
    setEditor({ kind: "closed" });
  }

  return (
    <section>
      <button
        type="button"
        onClick={() => setEditor({ kind: "create", name: "" })}
      >
        New label
      </button>
      <ul>
        {labels.map((label) => (
          <li key={label.id}>
            {label.name}{" "}
            <button
              type="button"
              onClick={() =>
                setEditor({ kind: "rename", id: label.id, name: label.name })
              }
            >
              Rename {label.name}
            </button>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
      {editor.kind !== "closed" && (
        <fieldset>
          <legend>{editor.kind === "create" ? "New label" : "Rename label"}</legend>
          <label>
            Name
            <input
              value={editor.name}
              onChange={(event) => updateName(event.currentTarget.value)}
            />
          </label>
          <button type="button" onClick={saveEditor}>
            Save
          </button>
          <button
            type="button"
            onClick={() => setEditor({ kind: "closed" })}
          >
            Cancel
          </button>
        </fieldset>
      )}
    </section>
  );
}
```

When `editor.kind` is `closed`, it has no name or label ID. A `create` mode has a draft name but no
ID; a `rename` mode carries the ID it will update. If creating and renaming were both allowed at
once, they would be independent modes and should not be combined this way.
